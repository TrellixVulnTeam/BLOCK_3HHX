Such pygame, such wonder!


## Description
This game was made with python using Pycharm by Alex Feng, with some technical help  from Shaya Jab, for the summative of the course ICS3U0. I have tried my best to make this game fun, challenging, and visually pleasing, but because of the time we were given, my original idea can’t be achieved. Some features have to be cut out of the game, i.e. game menu, soundtrack, different types of turrets, and more: although these things are not achieved a the end, I believe you will still enjoy the game

## How to play
1. The game will start immediately once the window is loaded, so be prepared.
2. Use the arrow key to move the character
3. If the character is near the turret, the player will have the ability to use the key “E” and the key “R”, indicated with the E key icon and the key icon
4. When the new keys are enabled, press “E” to pick up/set down the turret(the turret will automatically snap to grid, and move to another position if the position is illegal), press “R” to rotate the turret
5. Position the turret to shoot the enemy(bullet will automatically be shot, the exact mechanic of shooting is for the player to discover, or in your case, check the codes)
6. Eliminate the enemies to protect the bread in the middle, the bread has 5 hitpoints, if all runs out, game over
7. The enemy will gain speed over time, while the stats which benefit you, will not get better over time, hence the impossible
8. The score will increase over time, it has nothing to do with how many enemies you have eliminated
